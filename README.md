An unofficial RPM package of [Marble Browser](https://github.com/NetworkNeighborhood/Marble) designed for [Fedora](https://getfedora.org).
This repo was based on the original RPM packaging system created by [the4runner](https://github.com/the4runner/firefox-dev/) for the [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Special Note
This is just an RPM packaging for the said software and does not include any licenses of its own. The only additional file included is the `.desktop` file written based on the original executable from the Firefox Release Channel (default).
